    MataMaps is an all-in-one application designed to empower our students to better engage in clubs, events, accessibility, and campus life all from one interactive application!
    <br />
    Due to an ever-evolving student life on campus, the growth of clubs and on-campus events has fueled a need for a centralized application to facilitate these activities, and to keep them easily accessible to all students.
